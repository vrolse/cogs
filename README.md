# Cogs
Here are two work in progress cogs written in python to get info from aq2-tng server.

Many thanks to [TgT](https://github.com/m4son/) for help with the code and for the time to answer many of my questions so that things actually started to work. ðŸ˜„
This is my first attempt to code anything so take it for what it is! Everything might not work 100% ðŸ˜…

## Requirements

* [kkrypt0nn's discordbot-template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/) 
* [Qstat](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/qstat/)
* [pyrcon](https://github.com/texnofobix/pyrcon/)
* [q2admin with lua](https://github.com/m4son/q2admin)
* lastmatch.lua to use with q2admin to get info from '!last' command.
* and all imports (might be some that is not needed that I have missed to remove..)

## Usage
Follow instructions for the bot-template, pyrcon and qstat. Place copy the cog-files, lua and qstat into the correct directories.
Hope that was understanable.. ðŸ¤¨

## What now?
Feel free to manipulate this code as much as you want and for sure make it better. I'll help the best I can but I'm not so fast to answer questions.
